# Remote Work and Mental Health: A Data-Driven Analysis
### Implemented by Sibashis Kumar Sahu



This project analyzes how remote, hybrid, and onsite work impact well-being and productivity. The insights will help businesses optimize work policies, enhance productivity, and provide targeted mental health support. It also aids organizations in designing flexible work policies that balance employee well-being with business performance.



## Insights from EDA

1. Employees in the 40s age range might be underrepresented compared to other age groups, indicating a potential gap or anomaly in the dataset.
2. Employees distribution is fairly uniform across different experience levels, with periodic dips around specific intervals (e.g., near 10, 20, and 30 years). These dips could indicate a potential lack of representation in those ranges or specific trends in the workforce composition.
3. Employees are fairly evenly distributed across the three categories: Remote, Hybrid, and Onsite.
4. Diverse range of opinions about remote work satisfaction among employees, with no single category overwhelmingly dominant.
5. Stress levels are relatively evenly distributed across all work locations. No significant differences in stress levels are observed among the different work setups, indicating that stress might be influenced by factors other than work location.
6. Individuals with low stress levels generally report higher satisfaction with remote work compared to those with high stress levels. Satisfaction levels are relatively balanced across the stress categories, though high stress shows a slight increase in dissatisfaction. Neutral satisfaction is consistent across all stress levels, suggesting that factors other than stress may also influence remote work satisfaction.
7. Employees with no access to mental health resources tend to have slightly higher stress levels (High and Medium) compared to those with access. Providing access to mental health resources appears to help reduce high stress levels.
8. Employees with good sleep quality are distributed more evenly across mental health conditions. Poor sleep quality is associated with a higher occurrence of burnout and depression, highlighting the importance of sleep for mental health.
9. Anxiety and burnout are more prevalent in employees with high stress levels. Low stress levels are linked with fewer instances of burnout and anxiety, indicating the strong connection between stress and mental health conditions.
10. Across all work locations, daily physical activity slightly reduces social isolation compared to occasional or weekly physical activity. The difference in social isolation ratings is minimal, indicating that work location has limited influence on this aspect.
11. Employees in high-stress environments report lower satisfaction across all job roles. Job roles such as HR and Marketing show a broader range of satisfaction levels compared to more technical roles like Software Engineers.
12. The variability in work-life balance ratings is similar across stress levels.
13. Work-life balance is consistent across all age groups, with no noticeable differences influenced by age or satisfaction with remote work.
14. Burnout and Depression have slightly higher work-life balance ratings (around 3.1) when company support is moderate (2 or 3). Lower company support (1) generally results in slightly lower ratings (2.9) for most conditions. Unknown mental health conditions and low support (5) show the lowest ratings (2.8), indicating potential gaps in addressing employee needs.
15. Decreased Productivity is most common among those who are satisfied (605) and unsatisfied (590). Increased Productivity aligns more with neutral satisfaction (546) compared to satisfied or unsatisfied groups. No Change in Productivity is evenly distributed across all satisfaction levels, with slightly higher counts for neutral satisfaction (560).
16. Weak correlations across numerical variables as most values are close to 0. No strong relationships between key factors like Work-Life Balance Rating, Social Isolation Rating, or Hours Worked Per Week. Years of Experience and Age are slightly negatively correlated, likely reflecting diverse workforce demographics.
17. High Stress Level is strongly associated with Poor Sleep Quality, especially for conditions like Burnout and Anxiety. Medium Stress Level occurs more often with Good Sleep Quality when mental health conditions like Burnout or Depression are present. Low Stress Level frequently aligns with Unknown Mental Health Conditions or Poor Sleep Quality.
18. High or Medium stress levels often correlate with both satisfied and neutral satisfaction levels. Low stress appears less impactful unless paired with a strong work-life balance. Work-life balance ratings above 3 are consistently associated with satisfied or neutral satisfaction levels.
